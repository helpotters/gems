This repository contains my solutions to the problems listed in [[https:projecteuler.net][Project Euler]]. It only uses Ruby for now.

* Collatz Conjeture (Problem #14)
The Collatz Conjecture consists of two basic operations that results in an interesting emergence property of self-containing multiple solutions and the fact that it currently does not have a proof.

The rules are
- $n \rightarrow n/2: \text{ N is Even}$
- $n \rightarrow 3n + 1: \text{ N is Odd}$
With these simple rules, the operations result in chains that can have unpredictable lengths, and even have terms that are larger than the original starting term.

The requested submission for this project is to find the largest chain under a million.

Given that I am using Ruby, I think the best solution is to solve it algorithmically and use the least amount of operations I can code (to run on a Chromebook).
